## Explanation

This robots.txt file controls how web crawlers interact with a website. It allows all crawlers to access the entire site but requires them to wait 10 seconds between requests. 
However, the SemrushBot is entirely blocked from crawling any part of the site. This setup helps manage server traffic while restricting specific bots.
